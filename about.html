            <h2>Biography:</h2>
            <p class="indent">
                My name is <b>Bin Xu</b>, I'm a master's student in <abbr title="Boston University">BU</abbr>'s <u>Computer Science</u> program in the <abbr
                    title="Metropolitan">MET</abbr> college.
                After I graduated from <a href="https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/">Rutgers</a>, I worked as software developer. My responsibility in the Vanguard is to build trade
                API for the brokerage account team.
                In 2021 I plan to start my graduate study in computer science. I hope to learn more front-end technology in this class. I will be graduate in <time datetime="2022-12">Dec 2020</time>.
                I am taking this class because much of my web dev knowledge is self-taught, I google problems when I
                encounter them, so I don't have a solid foundation of web dev.
                I'm hoping to walk away from this course feeling confident that I understand how things work together,
                instead of just how to build them and make them work.
                Some topics I hope we will touch on include: employing MVC (model-view-controller) structures on large
                scale applications, connecting relational (sequel) and non-relational (no-sequel) databases to web apps,
                and traditional back-end structures (when not using a cloud service platform). I really appreciate the flexibility of taking an online course, and being able to view lectures on my own
                time.
            </p>

                The reason why I apply for MS in Computer Science is from my interest. I plan to focus on how the data analysis and machine leaning are applied on the robot design.
                Robotics is super interesting field for research on the data analysis and machine learning. MS in Computer Science provides flexible choice for me to choose
                the courses fits my preference.
                I can comprehensively learn how machine learning can be applied in the real world. I expect to design a robot by myself.
                I have several internship in different companies. I worked for a financial company before.
                I worked on trading-API team focusing on the brokage account. This is a web-based project which is used by other micro services to validate the transaction (sell, deposit, withdraw).
                I have internship in a supply chain company to build stock management system. Our team used Angular to develop front-end for fetching data from back-end.

                I also learn a lot technologies by myself in the free time.  I picked up web dev using <a href="https://reactjs.org/"
                                                                                                          target="_blank">React.js</a> and <a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Node.js</a> to build
                cross-platform software rendered with <a href="https://electronjs.org/" target="_blank">Electron.js</a>.
                I learn <a href="https://angular.io/"
                           target="_blank">Angular</a> during my internship in GEP .
                I had a great time and learned a ton on cloud computing and building web-apps using a hybrid-cloud or
                solely cloud-based structure, and am planning on taking their exams to become an <a

                Certified Cloud Practitioner</a>.
